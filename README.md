# Git

The easiest way to access the course materials stored on this site is to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).  Then, at the command line do 

    git clone https://github.com/ketch/AMCS-252-2021.git

That will create a directory on your computer with all the files stored here.  When new files are added online, all you need to do is go to the `AMCS-252-2021` directory on your machine and type

    git pull


# Jupyter and Python

To run the Jupyter notebooks with Python code that will be used in this course, I recommend the following options:

1. Local installation on your own computer (preferred).  Use the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or just install the required packages (numpy, matplotlib, scipy, jupyter) with pip if you prefer.
2. Use a cloud service: [My Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [Google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)
